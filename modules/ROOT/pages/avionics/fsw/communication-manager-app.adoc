= Communication Manager Application

== Overview

The Communication Manager Application serves as the primary interface to the CAN bus, preventing message collisions and handling queuing and prioritization. It operates on both OBC and Payload Controller.

== Data Input

* CAN buses
* SBN

== Data Output

* CAN buses
* SBN

== Data Processing

* Receive event messages
* Prevents message collisions
* Handles queuing and prioritization
