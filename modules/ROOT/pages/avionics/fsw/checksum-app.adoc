= Checksum Application

== Overview

The Checksum (CS) Application is used for ensuring the integrity of onboard memory. CS calculates Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs) on the different memory regions and compares the CRC values with a baseline value calculated at system startup. CS has the ability to ensure the integrity of cFE applications, cFE tables, the cFE core, the onboard operating system (OS), onboard EEPROM, as well as, any memory regions ("Memory") specified by the users.

This application is critical for detecting memory corruption that could lead to system failures or data integrity issues. By continuously monitoring memory regions and comparing them against known good baseline values, the Checksum application helps maintain system reliability and can trigger appropriate responses when corruption is detected.
