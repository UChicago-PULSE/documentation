= Limit Checker Application

== Overview

The Limit Checker (LC) Application monitors telemetry data points in a cFS system and compares the values against predefined threshold limits. When a threshold condition is encountered, an event message is issued and a Relative Time Sequence (RTS) command script may be initiated to respond/react to the threshold violation.

== Integration Points with PULSE-A Applications

* **All PULSE-A Applications**: Monitors telemetry data from all applications (see link:index.html#obc-applications[OBC Applications] and link:index.html#payload-controller-applications[Payload Controller Applications] sections)

== Integration Points with NASA Provided Applications

* **Stored Commands Application**: Initiates RTS command scripts when thresholds are violated (see link:stored-commands-app.html[Stored Commands Application])

* **All NASA cFS Applications**: Monitors telemetry data from all applications (see link:index.html#nasa-provided-cfs-applications[NASA Provided cFS Applications] section)
