= Memory Manager Application

== Overview

The Memory Manager (MM) Application is used for the loading and dumping system memory. MM provides an operator interface to the memory manipulation functions contained in the PSP (Platform Support Package) and OSAL (Operating System Abstraction Layer) components of the cFS. MM provides the ability to load and dump memory via command parameters, as well as, from files. If the operating system supports symbolic addressing, MM allows specifying the memory address using a symbolic address.
