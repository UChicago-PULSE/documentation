= PAT Application

== Overview

The PAT Application is a Payload Controller application that intakes data from other applications and orchestrates the PAT sequence.

== Data Input

* Receive data from the Quadrant-Photodiode Manager on positioning
* Receive relevant commands from Radio Manager
* Receive position data from GPS Application
* Accept telemetry from ground station

== Data Output

* Command the Laser Manager, FPGA Manager, and FSM Manager
* Send positioning commands to the ADCS Manager
* Log to Data-Collection Application

== Data Processing

* Maintain the PAT state throughout a sequence
* Ingest all positioning data and output a desired position and orientation
* Based on PAT state, send different data to the Laser and FPGA manager
* Communicate with the payload manager
