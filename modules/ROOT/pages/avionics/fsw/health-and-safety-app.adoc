= Health and Safety Application

== Overview

The Health and Safety (HS) Application provides functionality for Application Monitoring, Event Monitoring, Hardware Watchdog Servicing, Execution Counter Reporting (optional), and CPU Aliveness Indication.

== Integration Points with PULSE-A Applications

* **All PULSE-A Applications**: Monitors application health and execution (see xref:index.adoc#obc-applications[OBC Applications] and xref:index.adoc#payload-controller-applications[Payload Controller Applications] sections)

== Integration Points with NASA Provided Applications

* **All NASA cFS Applications**: Monitors application health and execution (see xref:index.adoc#nasa-provided-cfs-applications[NASA Provided cFS Applications] section)

== Integration Points with Hardware

* **Hardware Interface**: Provides CPU aliveness indication
* **System Hardware**: Monitors hardware health and safety parameters

== Integration with Other Software

* **Event Monitoring System**: Tracks system events and health indicators
