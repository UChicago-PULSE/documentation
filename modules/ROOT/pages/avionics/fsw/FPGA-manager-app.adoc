= FPGA Manager Application

== Overview

The FPGA Manager Application is a Payload Controller application that handles laser-modulation FPGA I/O and telemetry.

== Data Input

* Ethernet?

== Data Output

* Use SPI interface to output data to flash memory. Specifically, the data is going to be used to control the polarization of the FPGA, since it will pulse on/off two different lasers that are polarized differently

== Data Processing

* Relinquish control of flash memory input to FPGA
* FPGA re-engineering

== Integration Points with PULSE-A Applications

* xref:PAT-app.adoc[PAT Application]: Receives commands for FPGA control

== Integration Points with NASA Provided Applications

* xref:SBN-app.adoc[SBN Application]: Connects to Software Bus Network

== Integration Points with Hardware

* SPI Interface: Controls flash memory for FPGA
* FPGA Hardware Interface: Controls FPGA operations

== Integration Points with Other Software
