= FPGA Manager Application

== Overview

The FPGA Manager Application is a Payload Controller application that handles laser-modulation FPGA I/O and telemetry.

== Data Input

* Ethernet?

== Data Output

* Use SPI interface to output data to flash memory. Specifically, the data is going to be used to control the polarization of the FPGA, since it will pulse on/off two different lasers that are polarized differently

== Data Processing

* Relinquish control of flash memory input to FPGA
* FPGA re-engineering

== Integration Points

* **SPI Interface**: Controls flash memory
* **FPGA Hardware**: Direct control interface
* **Flash Memory**: Data storage and control
