= SBN Application

== Overview

The Software Bus Network (SBN) Application connects the cFE Software Bus (SB) to other buses, bridging the publish/subscribe messaging service to separate cFS instances in separate partitions, processes, processors, and/or networks. This application is essential for enabling communication between the OBC and Payload Controller, allowing them to seamlessly exchange messages between applications and coordinate operations.

The SBN application works by bridging the publish/subscribe messaging service, which means it can route messages from one cFS instance to another across different hardware platforms through a network connections. This is particularly important for PULSE-A's dual-computer architecture where the OBC and Payload Controller need to communicate closely.

== Integration Points with PULSE-A Applications

* **All PULSE-A Applications**: Provides messaging bridge services between OBC and Payload Controller applications (see xref:index.adoc#obc-applications[OBC Applications] and xref:index.adoc#payload-controller-applications[Payload Controller Applications] sections)

== Integration Points with NASA Provided Applications

* **All NASA cFS Applications**: Provides messaging bridge services between different cFS instances (see xref:index.adoc#nasa-provided-cfs-applications[NASA Provided cFS Applications] section)

== Integration Points with Hardware

* **Network Interface**: Connects to other cFS instances (Ethernet or other connection medium)

== Integration Points with Other Software

* **cFE Software Bus**: Primary interface for message routing within each computer
