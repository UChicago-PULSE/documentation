= Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

== Overview

The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous, full-duplex serial communication protocol commonly used in embedded systems to connect a master device (often a microcontroller) with one or more slave devices (peripherals). It is widely valued for its speed, simplicity, and flexibility, enabling high-throughput data transfers with relatively low overhead.

== Core Characteristics

* Synchronous - Data is transmitted in sync with a clock signal (SCLK) generated by the master.
* Full-duplex - Data flows in both directions simultaneously.
* Master-driven - The master controls the clock, initiates communication, and selects the slave device(s).
* Point-to-point or multi-slave - Works with a single slave or multiple slaves, each with a dedicated chip select line.

== Physical Interface

The most common configuration uses four signals:

|===
| Signal | Direction (Master POV) | Function

| SCLK (Serial Clock) | Output | Clock signal that synchronizes data exchange.
| CS / SS (Chip Select / Slave Select) | Output | Active-low line used to select a specific slave.
| MOSI (Master Out, Slave In) | Output | Data from master to slave.
| MISO (Master In, Slave Out) | Input | Data from slave to master.
|===

How it works:

. The master pulls CS low to select the target slave.
. On each clock pulse, a bit is shifted out from MOSI and simultaneously a bit is shifted in from MISO.
. When done, the master sets CS high to end the transaction.

== Communication Process

. Initialization - Master configures clock speed, CPOL, CPHA, and selects the desired slave.
. Selection - CS line goes low to activate the slave.
. Data Transfer -
.. Master shifts out data on MOSI.
.. Slave shifts out data on MISO.
.. Both sides sample incoming data on the configured clock edge.
. Completion - CS line returns high, ending communication.

== Performance and Limitations

* Speed - Can reach tens of MHz, much faster than I²C in most cases.
* Distance - Best for short PCB or cable runs (typically under ~1 m).
* No Addressing - Requires a separate CS line for each slave, limiting scalability.
* No Acknowledgment - Unlike I²C, there’s no ACK/NACK; error detection must be implemented at a higher layer if needed.

== Common Applications

SPI is found in many devices, including:

* Memory - Flash chips, EEPROMs
* Sensors - Accelerometers, gyroscopes, temperature sensors
* Display Modules - LCD, OLED
* Data Converters - ADCs, DACs
* Communication Modules - RF transceivers, Wi-Fi chips
