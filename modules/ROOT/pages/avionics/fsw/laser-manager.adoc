= Laser Manager Application

== Overview

The Laser Manager Application is a Payload Controller application that tracks state and drives both beacon and transmission lasers.

== Data Input

* Receive messages to turn on/off the laser (not sure if discrete units are required)

== Data Output

* Output event message on the SBN to Power Manager application (OBC) specifying that the laser should be turned on

== Data Processing

* Package signal to control laser (not much logic required)

== Integration Points with PULSE-A Applications
