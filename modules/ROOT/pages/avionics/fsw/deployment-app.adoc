= Deployment Application

== Overview

The Deployment Application is an OBC default application that sequences deployable actions after release and instructs the ADCS to begin detumbling.

== Data Input

* Receives data from Power Manager Application
* Receives data from ADCS Application
* Event message from Power Manager Application specifying sufficient power level reached
* ADCS topic data for detumbling status

== Data Output

* Sends burn fet/burn wire pins high to deploy magnetometer (initial bootup)
* Sends event message on SBN to ADCS application specifying detumbling procedure
* Sends burn fet/burn wire pins high to deploy solar panels and antenna (initial only)
* Sends event message over topic specifying deployment completed (initial only)
* Sends commands to Communication App

== Data Processing

* Upon initial bootup sends burn fet/burn wire pins high to deploy magnetometer
* Waits for event message from Power Manager Application specifying sufficient power level reached
* Sends event message on SBN to ADCS application specifying detumbling procedure
* Determines when detumbling is done by monitoring angular velocity and checking if it has maintained being under threshold for appropriate amount of time
* Sends burn fet/burn wire pins high to deploy solar panels and antenna (initial only)
* Sends event message over topic specifying deployment completed (initial only)
