= Stored Commands Application

== Overview

The Stored Commands (SC) Application allows a system to be autonomously commanded using sequences of commands that are loaded into SC. Each command has a time tag or wakeup count associated with it, permitting the command to be released for distribution at predetermined times or wakeup counts. SC supports both Absolute Time tagged command Sequences (ATSs) and multiple Relative Time tagged command Sequences (RTSs). The purpose of ATS commands is to be able to specify commands to be executed at a specific time. The purpose of Relative Time Sequence commands is to be able to specify commands to be executed at a relative wakeup count.
