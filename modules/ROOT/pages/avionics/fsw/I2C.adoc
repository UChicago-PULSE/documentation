= I^2^C

== Overview

Inter-Integrated Circuit (I^2^C) is a synchronous, half-duplex, multi-master serial communication protocol widely used to connect low to medium-speed peripherals to various digital logic devices.  
It is valued for its simplicity, scalability, and minimal pin usage, allowing multiple devices to share the same two-wire bus.

== Core Characteristics

* Synchronous - Data is transferred in sync with a clock signal (SCL) generated by the bus master.
* Half-duplex - Data flows in one direction at a time over a shared data line.
* Multi-master, multi-slave - Supports multiple masters and multiple slaves on the same bus.
* Address-based - Each device has a unique 7-bit or 10-bit address for identification.
* Open-drain / open-collector - Lines are actively pulled low but require pull-up resistors to return high.

== Physical Interface

I^2^C uses two bidirectional lines:

|===
| Signal | Direction (Master POV) | Function

| SCL (Serial Clock) | Output (from master) | Clock signal that synchronizes data transfers.
| SDA (Serial Data)  | Bidirectional        | Carries addresses, data, and control bits.
|===

How it works:

. Pull-up resistors keep both lines high when idle.
. A master initiates communication by sending SDA low while SCL is high.
. Data is sent in 8-bit bytes, with the most significant bit first.
. Each byte is followed by an acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) from the receiving device.
. A stop condition, the SDA going high while SCL is high, ends the communication.

== Communication Process

. **Initialization** - Master configures bus speed (Standard: 100 kHz, Fast: 400 kHz, Fast Plus: 1 MHz, High-Speed: 3.4 MHz).
. **Start Condition** - Master pulls SDA low while SCL is high to signal the beginning of communication.
. **Address + R/W Bit** - Master sends a 7- or 10-bit address and a read/write control bit.
. **Acknowledge** - Receiver pulls SDA low during the ACK clock pulse to confirm receipt.
. **Data Transfer** - Bytes are transferred one at a time, each followed by an ACK/NACK.
. **Stop Condition** - SDA returns high while SCL is high, releasing the bus.

== Performance and Limitations

* Speed - Supports several standardized modes up to 3.4 MHz
* Distance - Limited by bus capacitance, practical lengths are typically under 1 m at high speed.
* Pull-up Dependency - Resistor sizing affects rise times, speed, and power consumption.
* Arbitration - When multiple masters attempt to control the bus, hardware arbitration ensures only one master continues.
* Clock Stretching - Slaves can hold SCL low to delay communication if more processing time is needed.

== Common Applications

I^2^C is used in a wide range of devices, such as:

* Sensors - Temperature, pressure, accelerometers
* Real-Time Clocks (RTC)
* EEPROM and other small memory devices
* ADCs and DACs
* Power management ICs
