= Tailscale

== Overview

Tailscale is a zero‑config mesh VPN built on WireGuard. It creates a private, encrypted network between your devices using your existing identity provider for authentication. Devices connect peer‑to‑peer when possible and traverse NAT automatically.

== Whar does PULSE-A use Tailscale for

* Secure remote access to lab devices connected to the tailscale enabled router in the PULSE-A lab (e.g., BeagleBones, routers) without port forwarding
* Works over Wi‑Fi, Ethernet, or cellular across different networks

== Basic usage

Install Tailscale and sign in on each device and sign with the team google account. Then enable tailscale and connect to the lab router IP.
