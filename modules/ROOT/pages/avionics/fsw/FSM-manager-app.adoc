= FSM Manager Application

== Overview

The Fast-Steering Mirror (FSM) Manager Application is a Payload Controller application that performs calibration of, keeps track of current state of, and commands the FSM.

== Data Input

* PAT Application messages over SBN

== Data Output

* Output digital message to FSM driver through SPI

== Data Processing

* Given a desired angle, determine the correct motor activations
* Calibrate the FSM
* Keeps track of FSM angle
