= Quadrant-Photodiode Manager Application

== Overview

The Quadrant-Photodiode Manager Application is a Payload Controller application that processes signals from the Quadrant-Photodiode (QPD) and provides necessary transformations of the data for other applications.

== Data Input

* Read signals from QPD (what is hardware interface?)
* Convert these signals to a measurement of misalignment

== Data Output

* Output to PAT Application

== Data Processing

* Conversion of signals to a measurement

== Integration Points with PULSE-A Applications

* link:PAT-app.html[PAT Application]: Provides positioning data

== Integration Points with NASA Provided Applications

* link:SBN-app.html[SBN Application]: Connects to Software Bus Network

== Integration Points with Hardware

* QPD Hardware: Reads photodiode signals

== Integration Points with Other Software
