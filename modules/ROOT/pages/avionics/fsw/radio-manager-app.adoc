== Data Input

* Read command output from radio and radio health data using UART
* Accepts input from the limit checker application in case of a detected fault

== Data Output

* Send satellite telemetry packets to the radio module
* Transmit heartbeat signals to the watchdog application

== Data Processing

* Parse data stream into a formatted command, and publish this command on the software bus
