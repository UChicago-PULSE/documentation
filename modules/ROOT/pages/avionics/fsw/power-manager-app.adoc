= Power Manager Application

== Overview

The Power Manager Application is an OBC default application that monitors the PDU and manages power distribution and thermal control.

== Data Input

* Reads application configuration table
* Direct data input from dedicated power I2C line
* Takes in input from other applications for activating power for devices
* Accepts input from the limit checker application in case of a detected fault

== Data Output

* Direct data output over dedicated power I2C line
* Current power state and telemetry output over Power topic

== Data Processing

* Manages and stores current state of the PDU, ensuring that parameters (thermals, voltage, etc.) remain within acceptable limits
* Monitors current power level of battery pack and determines if satellite needs to enter power saving mode
* Checks if current parameters allow for a power bus to be enabled when requested
* Determines when an acceptable power level is reached that allows for detumbling
