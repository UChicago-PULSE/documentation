= Payload Manager Application

== Overview

The Payload Manager Application is an OBC application that uses NASA's SBN to track the Payload Controller's state and relay key events during the PAT sequence.

== Data Input

* Reads application configuration table
* Accepts input from the limit checker application in case of a detected fault
* Reads incoming data from payload topics
* Accepts requests to modify payload behavior

== Data Output

* Current payload health and state on a Payload topic
* Request to the ADCS application for change of targeting offset

== Data Processing

* Monitors current state of the payload
* Determines if bounds of FSM tracking are reached
* If bounds are reached determines an offset for the ADCS
* Handles and prioritizes requests for changes in payload behavior

== Integration Points with PULSE-A Applications

* xref:power-manager-app.adoc[Power Manager Application]: Requests power activation

== Integration Points with NASA Provided Applications

* xref:SBN-app.adoc[SBN Application]: Connects to Software Bus Network

== Integration Points with Hardware

* **Payload Controller**: Monitors payload hardware state

== Integration Points with Other Software

* **Software Bus**: Publishes Payload topic data and reads payload topics
