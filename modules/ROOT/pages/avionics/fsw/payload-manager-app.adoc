= Payload Manager Application

== Overview

The Payload Manager Application is an OBC application that uses NASA's SBN to track the Payload Controller's state and relay key events during the PAT sequence.

== Data Input

* Reads application configuration table
* Accepts input from the limit checker application in case of a detected fault
* Reads incoming data from payload topics
* Accepts requests to modify payload behavior

== Data Output

* Current payload health and state on a Payload topic
* Request to the ADCS application for change of targeting offset

== Data Processing

* Monitors current state of the payload
* Determines if bounds of FSM tracking are reached
* If bounds are reached determines an offset for the ADCS
* Handles and prioritizes requests for changes in payload behavior
