= Watchdog Monitor Application

== Overview

The Watchdog Monitor Application sends heartbeats to the external watchdog timer and exchanges heartbeats with the Payload Controller to ensure both computers remain operational, enabling fail-over if the OBC becomes unresponsive.

== Data Input

* Incoming heartbeat signal from Payload Controller Application
* Do we need a signal from the watchdog itself?

== Data Output

* Heartbeat signal to the watchdog timer on I2C and payload controller on CAN
* Alter watchdog timeout length

== Data Processing

* Reboot payload controller if unresponsive through a reset line

== Integration Points with PULSE-A Applications

== Integration Points with Hardware

* Watchdog GPIO pins: Sends heartbeat signals
* Reset line: Controls payload controller reboot

== Integration Points with Other Software
