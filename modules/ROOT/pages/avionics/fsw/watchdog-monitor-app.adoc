= Watchdog Monitor Application

== Overview

The Watchdog Monitor Application sends heartbeats to the external watchdog timer and exchanges heartbeats with the Payload Controller to ensure both computers remain operational, enabling fail-over if the OBC becomes unresponsive.

== Data Input

* Incoming heartbeat signal from Payload Controller Application
* Do we need a signal from the watchdog itself?

== Data Output

* Heartbeat signal to the watchdog timer on I2C and payload controller on CAN
* Alter watchdog timeout length

== Data Processing

* Reboot payload controller if unresponsive through a reset line

== Integration Points

* **I2C Interface**: Sends heartbeat to watchdog timer
* **CAN Interface**: Exchanges heartbeats with Payload Controller
* **Reset Line**: Controls payload controller reboot
* **Payload Controller**: Monitors heartbeat status
