=Testing Breakdown 
The quantitative testing requirements below are preliminarily drawn from several CubeSat heritage practices, including the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD) Interface Definition Document (IDD), the NASA Launch Services Program Level Dispenser (LSP-REQ-3.17), the CubeSat Requirements Document (CDS 14.1), and SMC-S-016. As previously noted, specific numerical values, such as temperature margins and vibrational frequency, remain subject to refinement as our launch provider finalizes integration parameters and as our internal design margins evolve through system-level analysis and review. Vibration Testing
=Vibration testing is a fundamental step in our testing program as it allows us to ensure that the spacecraft can withstand launch loads. Factors such as engine thrust and aerodynamic pressure upon launch subjects the spacecraft to intense mechanical loads; simulating these vibrations on the ground enables proper inspection of the PULSE-A spacecraft’s structure, components, and fastenings during these stressful conditions, allowing us to determine whether or not the spacecraft will survive the launch without damage or failure. 
Our vibration testing results will be implemented into an integrated test report outlining test set-up, as-run accelerometer, response plots, and post-vibration functional and inspection results in order to align with proper safety requirements and corresponding documentation. 
==Random Vibration: 
We plan to implement a “soft stow” flight configuration during our vibration testing campaign, meaning that hardware components will be restrained with soft, flight-equivalent materials such as foam and bubblewrap. We selected a soft stow profile as it reduces the risk of over-constraining or harming sensitive components during testing, and also better simulates an actual in-flight environment. Furthermore, items within the soft-stow configuration do not experience intense mechanical shock, eliminating the need for a standalone shock test and thus minimizing costs, as well. 
It is important to note that the choice of stow configuration is also dependent on the decisions of the deployer or launch provider. We will only effectuate a “hard stow” profile if external specifications require as such. 
Our vibration testing program consists of the application of broadband vibration to three perpendicular axes for 1 minute, with a frequency band spanning from 20 Hz to 2000 Hz, and the acceleration spectral density (ASD) spanning from 4e-2 g2/Hz to 2.6e-3 g2/Hz. 
==Sinusoidal Vibration: 
Sinusoidal vibration testing—in particular, low-level sine sweep testing—will be implemented into our testing program if required by our deployer or launch service provider. This type of testing involves slowly sweeping through a range of frequencies to detect structural resonances and ensure no abnormal responses. If we receive instructions to perform a low-level sine sweep on our flight hardware, we will conduct the test prior to random vibration testing, as the former involves harsher vibrational conditions that may attack any hidden vulnerabilities; the low-level sine sweep would essentially act as a “pre-check” routine in our vibration testing scheme. 
Thermal Testing
=Thermal testing is critical for verifying that the PULSE-A spacecraft will be able to withstand LEO conditions. Due to the varying temperature conditions in orbit, the spacecraft will experience rapid, extreme temperature swings that may stress materials and components. 
Thermal contraction and expansion, for example, can lead to cracks in fastenings, peeling insulations, and overall weakening structural elements. Therefore, we need to simulate these oscillating, intense conditions to prevent these damages and failures. Beyond verifying structural integrity, we also aim to conduct thermal tests that allow us to detect potential manufacturing defects, and assess overall functionality. By exposing the hardware to controlled temperature extremes, we can verify that all components perform across their expected range, isolate any faulty electronics or connectors, and confirm that our on-board active heaters function properly. 
The main facility we will be utilizing in our thermal testing is a thermal vacuum chamber (TVAC), location TBD, as well as a clean room that ensures no external spacecraft contamination. 
==Thermal Vacuum Cycling: 
Thermal vacuum cycling simulates the LEO rapid temperature swings in a vacuum cycle. It is a crucial component of our thermal testing campaign and the verification of a flight-ready spacecraft as it will match the heat transfer conditions of space, allowing for proper detection of hardware and manufacturing defects, and confirmation of expected component functionality. 
These tests also include thermal balance tests; instead of reproducing rapid, extreme temperature swings, the balance tests will hold the spacecraft at a steady-state hot and cold temperature. In sum, the balance tests act as a calibration check for our thermal design, allowing us to verify that our thermal control system’s components remain within temperature limits under both worst-case hot and cold conditions. 
The vacuum cycling tests will be performed at vacuum levels of 10 x 10-4 Torr. The maximum temperature range will be set to be MPE +/- 5℃, the minimum range  -9 -3/+0℃, and the minimum temperature rate of change will be 5℃/min. The number of cycles will be 4, with a dwell time of one hour at extreme temperature after thermal stabilization. 
==Thermal Vacuum Bakeout: 
The thermal vacuum bakeout test is a crucial component of contamination reduction for the spacecraft hardware. Outgassing—the release of volatile compounds from materials such as adhesives or plastics—risks degrading performance as vaporized contaminants may condense on sensitive surfaces. In order to protect our lenses, sensors, heaters, and similar vulnerable components, we will utilize a residual gas analyzer to determine outgassing levels and remove any possible volatile contaminants that hinder our mission’s success. 
The bakeout test will be performed at vacuum levels of 1 x 10-4 Tor, at a minimum temperature of 70℃. We aim to ensure a minimum temperature rate of change of less than 5℃/min, with a minimum dwell time of three hours after thermal stabilization.  
In terms of safety requirements for the bakeout test and recorded outgassing values, all non-metallic materials that will be exposed to the vacuum environment must be documented in the spacecraft’s Bill of Materials (BOM). Each listed material shall comply with outgassing limits defined by NASA’s materials standards, specifically a Total Mass Loss (TML) of no more than 1.0% and a Collected Volatile Condensable Material (CVCM) content of no more than 0.1%. No exceptions will be granted based on the anticipated duration of vacuum exposure, as the spacecraft will operate in the vicinity of the International Space Station (ISS), where contamination control requirements are strictly enforced. We will also utilize the BOM in the formation of a Material Identification Usage List (MIUL) to reinforce compliance with enforced regulations. All materials deemed by toxicologists to be above THL 2 will be noted in our Ground Safety Package in compliance with toxicity safety regulations. 
==Electronic Burn-in: 
Our electronic burn-in test, necessary for the detection of defective components, will consist of long-term, continuous operation of the spacecraft’s electrical parts. The sustained burn-in conditions will allow us to detect any early-life failures of the spacecraft before launch, and to verify the spacecraft’s long-term, in-orbit operational stability and overall survival. 
The burn-in test consists of the combined duration of all other thermal testing—that is, vacuum cycling and bakeout—with an additional burn-in period of at least 100 hours. If the spacecraft maintains its functional and structural integrity over these 100 hours failure-free, then we will be able to verify the completion and success of the test. Note that this test may be performed at ambient pressure.
