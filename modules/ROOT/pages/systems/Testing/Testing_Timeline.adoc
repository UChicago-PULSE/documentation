Our environmental testing campaign will occur during our testing sequence phase within our broader Assembly, Integration, and Testing (AIT) program. The testing sequence follows the payload and CubeSat integration phase, and proceeds deployment and launch. Please navigate to the Systems Interfaces page for our AIT block diagram that demonstrates the program visually. 

Below you will find our environmental testing sequence block diagram, which demonstrates the order in which the different tests will be performed. In between each standalone environmental testing segment, we will perform abbreviated functional and performance tests in order to ensure that no spacecraft components suffered damage or complications during a prior test. 

Note that we begin the sequence with “structural tests.” This portion includes moment of inertia and center of gravity tests that assess the spacecraft’s mass properties, verify alignment with design models, and confirm compliance with launch provider requirements. We do not include a detailed technical explanation of the structural tests in the “Testing Breakdown” section because these procedures follow well-established, standardized methods defined by the launch provider and industry norms.
