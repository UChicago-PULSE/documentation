= RF Ground Station Documentation

The RF system is designed to maintain a strong link to the satellite, and to allow for frequent health beacon and GPS data transmission in order to support the experimental laser communications operations. 

Our RF link-budget analysis indicates margins of 21.7 dB on the uplink and 20.3 dB on the downlink, ensuring a strong, reliable signal path for all mission phases.

The following is a block diagram for the RFGS.

== Hardware

All RF communications will be conducted in the amateur UHF band at a frequency between 435 and 438 MHz using a half-duplex system. We will use a Cross-Yagi antenna for its high gain and ease of use, which will be connected to a roof mount with a Yaesu G-5500 rotator controlled by the CSN Technologies Self-contained Antenna Tracker. The uplink and downlink will be supported by the ICOM-9700 transceiver, with a SSB SP70 masthead preamplifier connected to a DCW 2004 B power coupler to boost weak signals from the satellite. The Cross-Yagi antenna will transmit right-handed circularly polarized RF signals at 30 Watts and receive linearly polarized RF signals from the satellite. While this polarization mismatch will decrease the strength of the received signal by approximately 3 dB, the combination of circular transmission and linear reception will ensure reliable signal reception from the satellite regardless of its orientation.

== RF Protocol

The RFGS will be capable of receiving telemetry and sending commands and files using the AX.25 standard amateur radio protocol, which will wrap CubeSat Space Protocol (CSP) packets containing command and telemetry data. It will receive and transmit at 9600 baud using GFSK modulation. Packets will be decoded using a Kantronics 9612 XE hardware terminal node controller (TNC) and a ground station computer. The KISS protocol will be used to transmit packets more efficiently between the TNC and computer.


== RFGS Location

We intend to deploy the RFGS on the roof of the Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery at the University of Chicago. This location will give the antenna an unobstructed line-of-sight for the satelliteâ€™s orbit. This location will enable the RFGS to connect with the satellite at an elevation of less than 5 degrees, allowing the RFGS to initiate the pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) sequence before the satellite is high enough to begin optical transmission.
