= Link Budget Guide


Because we don't live in a vacuum, any time you send a radio or optical signal, you will not receive 100% of the transmitted power at the receiver. This is because the signal interacts with its enviroment as it travels from point A to point B. These interactions, known as noise, alter the strength of your signal. To deal with this, we create a link budget, which tracks how the strength of the signal changes during the transmission process, giving a measure of received power. This short document will provide a guide on elementary noise analysis and link budget construction.
