= Optical Ground Station

The optical ground station (OGS) is the receiving portion of PULSE-Aâ€™s optical experiment. Since optical communications are directional, the OGS must track the transmission laser with a pointing accuracy of 1.4mrad.
The optical ground station tracks, collects, and decodes the transmitted signal using four assembles: tracking,  polarization state preparation, signal decoding, and beacon.
