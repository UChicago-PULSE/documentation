= Laser Driving

== Purpose
- Generate orthogonally linearly polarized light at 1550nm
- ON/OFF modulation at 1-10MHz

= Overview of the requirement 
The laser driving setup generates two orthogonal, high-purity linear polarization states. In the Injection Assembly, each state passes through a quarter-wave plate, converting it to either right-handed (RCP) or left-handed (LCP) circular polarization. Using FPGA-controlled modulation at 1–10 MHz, this implements Circular Polarization Shift Keying (CPolSK), where binary data is encoded in the handedness of the light—left for one bit value, right for the other.

Other literature describes alternative approaches, such as employing a single laser with a fast electro-optic modulator to switch polarization states. However, the resulting modulation scheme is functionally the same. Despite using different hardware paths, they ultimately transmit the same sequence of right- and left-handed circular polarization states to encode the data.
